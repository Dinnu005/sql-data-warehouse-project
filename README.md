## 🚀 Project Overview
This project covers:
- **Data Modeling**: Designing a star/snowflake schema for the warehouse.
- **ETL Process**: Extract, Transform, Load scripts to populate the warehouse.
- **Analytical Queries**: Complex queries for reporting and insights.

## 📊 Features
✅ Star schema or snowflake schema design  
✅ Fact and dimension tables  
✅ ETL implementation using SQL scripts  
✅ Analytical queries for common business questions  

## 🔧 Technologies Used
- **SQL Server** (or MySQL / PostgreSQL, update accordingly)
- SQL scripts for ETL and analytics
